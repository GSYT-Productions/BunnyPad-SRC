Name the icon images as follows:
  "selectall.png"
  "share.png"
  "support.png"
  "team.png"
  "undo.png"
  "wordwrap.png"
  "charmap.png"
  "copy.png"
  "cut.png"
  "delete.png"
  "document.png"
  "exit.png"
  "find.png"
  "font.png"
  "info.png"
  "new.png"
  "open.png"
  "paste.png"
  "pdf.png"
  "printer.png"
  "redo.png"
  "replace.png"
  "save.png"
  "saveas.png"
  "cake.png"
  "nocake.png"
  "packinfo.txt"
put those in a "images/" directory,
# For "packinfo.txt", please use the following format:
```
Name: {pack name}
Creator: {Creator of the Pack (Screennames, please)}
Special Notes: 	{Used for attributing icon makers or resources used}
```

## All of these need to be in a ZIP file, added to your fork's "/iconpacks" directory, and then submitted in a pull request. We manually look at the icon packs and determine which ones get added into the iconpack database.
